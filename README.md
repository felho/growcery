## Issues

### Small todos

- [ ] Rename files: topnav to top-nav, syncuser to sync-user

### Login / user management

- [ ] Saving user is not perfect now, it is possible that a user is created already, but not yet logged in, so we need to first check whether a user with the email address exists or not.
- [ ] User has to be added to the default organization until multiple ones are supported
- [ ] We need to work out how a user is connected to an organization
