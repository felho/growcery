# File and Directory Naming Conventions

- All file and directory names in the project must use kebab-case.
  - Example: `comp-matrix-editor`, `get-all-functions.ts`, `user-profile`
- No camelCase, PascalCase, or snake_case is allowed for file or directory names.
- This rule applies to all folders and files, including components, pages, server, and utility files.
